# Importing a placeholder image

If you own an NFT from the [Kanvas Gods](./kanvasgods) collection, a new button appears below the eraser. This allows you to select an image on your computer and import it onto the canvas.

The maximum size in pixels of this image, which is its width x its height, depends on the tier of the NFT you own. Here's a table summarizing them.

| Category  | Max imported image size | Square size image equivalent |
| :-------: | :---------------------: | :--------------------------: |
| Almighty  |      65536 pixels       |        256px x 256px         |
| Olympian  |      16384 pixels       |        128px x 128px         |
|  Divine   |       4096 pixels       |         64px x 64px          |
| Mythical  |       256 pixels        |         16px x 16 px         |
| Classical |        64 pixels        |          8px x 8px           |

Once the image has been selected, you can drag it onto the canvas and click to place it. This will act as a placeholder, i.e. it won't be saved on the canvas but will help you draw. To save it on the canvas, you need to fill it pixel by pixel.

::: tip
The advantage of importing an image is that you have a reference and colors are automatically selected according to which pixel of the imported image you are hovering over.
