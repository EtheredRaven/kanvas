# Placing pixels

Let's get to the heart of the game, a very simple action: place a pixel!

## MANA and pixel capacity

Once you've connected and unlocked your wallet, you'll see two bars appear at the bottom of your screen.

The blue bar represents your MANA. This MANA is consumed when you place a pixel, and fills up automatically according to the amount of $KOIN you have.

The red bar represents the number of pixels you can place. The maximum number is equal to the amount of $KAN you have. When another player places a pixel on top of one you've already placed, you win a new pixel to place on the canvas.

::: info No more pixels...
When you have no pixels left to place, all you have to do is wait for another player to place one on top of yours, or you can buy new $KAN.

## Chosing the color of the pixel

To choose the color of the pixel you want to place, click on the black square below the wallets rectangle. You can then choose your color via hexadecimal code, RGB, saved colors or directly from the color chart.

## Placing a pixel

Once you've chosen a color, it's easy to place the pixel: just click where you want to place it. A blinking placeholder indicates the position where it will be placed.

You must then validate the transaction if you're using a third-party application (Konio, Kondor etc...).

The pixel continues to blink until the transaction is validated. When the transaction is successful, information appears in a green rectangle in the bottom right-hand corner. If it fails, the error is also displayed, but in a red rectangle.
