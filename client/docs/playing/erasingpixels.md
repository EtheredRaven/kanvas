# Erasing pixels

Let's see another very simple action: erasing a pixel!

## Pixel capacity

You can delete a pixel you've placed to regain $KAN. Simply click on the eraser tool on the right of the screen, then click on a pixel you've placed. The pixel erasing capability per transaction is the same as the one for placing it. The default value is **5 pixels** per transaction and can go up to **100 pixels** if you own one of the best [Kanvas God](./kanvasgods)

::: info Erasing before saving
If you've made a mistake when drawing, you can also delete a pixel that hasn't yet been saved (the ones that blink). Simply select the eraser and click on the blinking pixel you wish to delete.
