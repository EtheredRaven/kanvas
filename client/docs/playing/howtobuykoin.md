# How to buy $KOIN

First step first ! Since Kanvas is on the Koinos blockchain, you will first need to get some $KOIN to swap it for $KAN !

## Creating a wallet

There are several easy-to-use wallets available to use for Koinos for now :

- [Konio](https://konio.io/) (our partner) : a mobile wallet available on iOS & Android, **compatible with Wallet Connect**, [open sourced](https://github.com/konio-io) and created by E-Time
- [Kondor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kondor/ghipkefkpgkladckmlmdnadmcchefhjl) : a browser extension, like Metamask, available for Chrome and Brave, [open sourced](https://github.com/joticajulian/kondor/) and created by Julian Gonzales
- [My Koinos Wallet](https://mykw.vercel.app/) : a web wallet that can be used on mobile, [open sourced](https://github.com/roaminro/my-koinos-wallet) and created by Roamin
- [Portal](https://portal.armana.io/) : a mobile app with wallet features, closed sourced and created by Ron Hamenahem

We have a small preference for Konio on mobile and for Kondor on the web. Just install one of them and follow the instructions.

::: danger Write you seed !
Don't forget to write and save your seed/mnemonic. If you lose it, you won't be able to recover your funds of you uninstall the wallet. Store it somewhere safe and never share it. Stealing it is equivalent to stealing all your funds !

## Buying on MEXC

::: warning MEXC for US residents
MEXC is not available to US residents! If you're American, you'll first need to install a VPN ([TorVPN](https://www.torproject.org/fr/download/), [Cyberghost](https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/) etc...) to change your IP location and access the exchange. You can also use the second option below,KoinSwap.
:::

**MEXC** is a centralized exchange on which you can buy $KOIN. Create an account and go on the [$KOIN trading page](https://www.mexc.com/fr-FR/exchange/KOIN_USDT). You can follow [this official tutorial](https://www.mexc.com/how-to-buy) to get the detailed process about how to buy a crypto on MEXC.

## Buying on Coinstore

**Coinstore** is another centralizes exchange on which you can buy $KOIN. Create an account and go on the [$KOIN trading page](https://www.coinstore.com/#/spot/KOINUSDT) on which you can buy some $KOIN in exchange of $USDT.

## Sending it out

Once you have bought some $KOIN on a centralized exchange, you will need to withdraw it from the exchange to your personal Koinos wallet you have created on the part above. Copy and paste you Koinos address as the withdrawal address. You can follow [this official tutorial](https://www.mexc.com/support/articles/360030808111) to get the detailed process about how to withdraw a crypto from MEXC. It is pretty similar for Coinstore.

::: danger Double-checking
Please always double-check the address you have copied as the withdrawal recipient. Once the withdrawal has been accepted / processed, you cannot cancel it. Thus, if the address is wrong or contains a typo, you won't be able to recover your money in any way !
