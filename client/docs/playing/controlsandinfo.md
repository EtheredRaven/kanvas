# Controls

Let's start with the Kanvas controls. You don't need to have connected your wallet to perform these actions.

## Moving the canvas

You can move around the canvas using the mouse, by holding down the right mouse button and then moving the mouse in the opposite direction to that in which you want to move the canvas. These controls are fairly simple and intuitive.

## Zooming

In the same way, zooming in and out is made very intuitive with the mouse wheel or your fingers on the touchpad.

## Showing pixel info

When you hover over a pixel, its information is displayed in a rectangle in the bottom right-hand corner of your screen. This contains its color, position and the name of the owner who placed it. If this address is linked to a [Koinos Account Protocol (KAP)](https://kap.domains/) address, this will be displayed instead of the address.
