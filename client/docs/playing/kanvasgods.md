### Pixel capability

The first and foremost capability offered by the NFTs is the enhanced pixel placement and erasing function. Depending on the tier of the NFT owned, players can place or erase a maximum number of pixels in a single transaction. This feature significantly augments the creative potential and efficiency of players on the Kanvas platform. For instance, an NFT from the 'Almighty' tier allows for up to 100 pixels to be placed or erased per transaction, while an 'Olympian' tier NFT permits up to 50 pixels. The default value will be **5 pixels per transaction**.

### Image placeholders

The collection introduces an image importing function, where players can upload an image as a placeholder to guide their artwork on Kanvas. The maximum image size is determined by the NFT tier owned. This placeholder aids in color selection and design layout, although players still need to manually fill in the image, maintaining an interactive and creative process.

::: warning Capabilities are not cumulative !
NFT capabilities in "Gods on Kanvas" are not cumulative. Owning multiple NFTs across different tiers will not combine their features; the system only recognizes the highest tier associated with the player's address. This ensures that gameplay remains balanced and fair, with the highest tier NFT dictating the level of capabilities available to the player.

### Visibility and future capabilities

As "Kanvas Gods" evolves, new capabilities may be introduced, especially with higher tiers. These could include unique features like pixel protection in specific zones for set periods, powers related to a god's realm, or cosmetic effects visible when placing pixels. Community suggestions will play a crucial role in shaping these future enhancements. Additionally, the profiles of god-tier NFT holders will be prominently displayed on the leaderboard and in account details. When other users hover over pixels placed by these holders, they'll see an indication of the holder's powerful status, adding an exciting social element to the Kanvas experience.
