Chainge is **chain-agnostic** which means the swapping process is cross-chained automatically.
:::

1. Download the Chainge app on the [Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fusion.chainge.android&hl=fr&gl=US&pli=1) or on the [Apple store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chainge-finance/id1578987516)

3. Once you received or imported your $KOIN, click on **Swap** on the main page and select $KOIN and $KAN. Enter the amount you want to buy and process the swap.

::: warning Gas fees
Since Chainge is working on the Fusion blockchain, you will need some Fusion to pay for the gas fees if you have never used the app. You can buy Fusion on MEXC for example and send it to your Fusion Chainge wallet.

## Issues with slippage tolerance

::: tip Slippage
Slippage characterizes the difference between the expected price of an asset and the actual price at which the trade is executed
:::

Since it is a new exchange, low liquidities are not rare on KoinDX. Hence, swapping can fail due to low slippage tolerance. You can change to a higher slippage tolerance in your settings by clicking on the âš™ gear on the top right of the swapping page. However, be aware that is will cost you more money than the current market price for this amount. By buying this quantity, you will make the price rise !
