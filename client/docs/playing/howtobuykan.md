## Issues with slippage tolerance

::: tip Slippage
Slippage characterizes the difference between the expected price of an asset and the actual price at which the trade is executed
:::

Since it is a new exchange, low liquidities are not rare on KoinDX. Hence, swapping can fail due to low slippage tolerance. You can change to a higher slippage tolerance in your settings by clicking on the âš™ gear on the top right of the swapping page. However, be aware that is will cost you more money than the current market price for this amount. By buying this quantity, you will make the price rise !
