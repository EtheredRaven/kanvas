In order to play the game, you must own $KAN and be able to prove it. You need to connect your wallet to the application.</p><p>To connect the wallet on which you bought your $KAN, the first step is to click on the button <code>Connect</code> in the top right-hand corner of the screen.</p><p>If you&#39;ve already added a wallet, you can click on the wallet in question and then on <code>âŠ• Add new Wallet</code> at the bottom of the card.</p><h3 id="option-1-kondor" tabindex="-1">Option 1 : Kondor <a class="header-anchor" href="#option-1-kondor" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Option 1 : Kondor&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>To connect your Kondor accounts, click on <code>Use Kondor</code>.
