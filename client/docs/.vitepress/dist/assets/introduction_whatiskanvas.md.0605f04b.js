The level of decentralization can range from a game where every action is a transaction on the blockchain (totally decentralized) to a game on a classic server with only a token to reward players (token-governed game).</p></div><h2 id="a-fully-decentralized-game" tabindex="-1">A fully decentralized game <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-fully-decentralized-game" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;A fully decentralized game&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In the case of Kanvas, the mechanisms and user actions all involve transactions on Koinos via a <a href="./../reference/smartcontract.html">smart-contract</a>. The server and client of the <a href="https://kanvas-app.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">kanvas-app.com</a> website are merely an intermediary to facilitate user interaction and pixel map visualization. However, there is no need for the kanvas-app.com site for the game to continue to exist, since it is stored entirely decentralized on Koinos.</p><h2 id="a-game-based-on-a-viral-concept-r-place" tabindex="-1">A game based on a viral concept, r/place <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-game-based-on-a-viral-concept-r-place" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;A game based on a viral concept, r/place&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The concept behind Kanvas is very simple. It&#39;s inspired by the r/place event that took place for its first edition in 2015 on Reddit.</p><details class="details custom-block"><summary>I want to know more about r/place</summary><p>On r/place, each player could place a colored pixel on a canvas every five minutes. Communities would then come together to draw images that represented them. It was then a matter of protecting them from other communities. This is how the concept of &quot;pixel war&quot; came about. After a predefined period of time, the event came to an end, and the final canvas became a collaborative work of art.</p></details><h2 id="a-collaborative-canvas" tabindex="-1">A collaborative canvas <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-collaborative-canvas" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;A collaborative canvas&quot;">​</a></h2><p>On both Kanvas and r/place, players can place colored pixels on a canvas.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">The size of Kanvas&#39; canvas</p><p>The Kanvas&#39; canvas is 1000 pixels by 1000 pixels.
