# What is $KAN ?

**$KAN** is the token of the Kanvas project.

## Purposes

$KAN serves several purposes:

- It is useful within the game, since it determines the maximum number of pixels the user can simultaneously hold on the pixel map.
- It helps finance the project, its development and maintenance costs.
- It unites the Kanvas community around a single financial value, encouraging community members to promote the project and thus obtain added value from their investment in it.
- It raises the project's profile by listing the token on exchange and listing platforms (Coinmarketcap, Coingecko, etc.).

## Launch

KAN will be launched in two stages:

- The first is an airdrop to let the crypto community know about the project by sharing it on social networks. This stage will take place in **August 2023**.
- The second is a presale via a DAO organized by KoinDX in **September 2023**. The funds raised will be used to finance the project and the liquidity pool on KoinDX. The starting price will be communicated on social media before the start of the fundraising.

Here's the token allocation table :

|            Position            |     Percentage      |
| :----------------------------: | :-----------------: |
|            Airdrop             |   60,000 KAN (2%)   |
|         Presale (DAO)          |  900,000 KAN (30%)  |
|    Liquidity pool (KoinDX)     |  450,000 KAN (15%)  |
| Development & marketing wallet | 1,590,000 KAN (53%) |

Half of the total KAN supply will be kept in the development and marketing wallet to promote the project through bonuses, airdrops and contests!

## Distribution of funds

The funds raised during the presale (DAO) will be distributed as follows:

|            Position            | Percentage of raised KOIN |
| :----------------------------: | :-----------------------: |
|    Liquidity pool (KoinDX)     |    50% = 450 000 eqKAN    |
| Development & marketing wallet |            50%            |

This distribution ensures a starting price in the liquidity pool equal to the sales price via the DAO.
